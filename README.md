# brucelee352.github.io â€” Data Portfolio Version 2 

Hey guys, here's the 2nd version of my Data Analysis Portfolio! Built with Jekyll! 

Frankly, the last few months have been hard in a unique way. Somewhere along the line, I became very disillusioned with the idea of working anywhere, especially in Education. However, I'm here. I built this and every project featured on my portfolio and I'm moving forward. I'm not giving up. 

During the process of finding something new, I've met some really awesome people who have helped me in their own way along the way. People I'll always be grateful to for trying to help me in a bad situation. 

Work is supposed to give you an opportunity at actualization; the ability to realize your potential.  Work is also supposed to be an equivalent exchange, if you think you are giving more of yourself for not enough of whatever. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.

If you take away anything from reading this, no matter how hard things get, push forward. Do well because you want to do well and eschew the need to please others by living up to their expecations. 

Thank you,
Bruce
