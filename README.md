# brucelee352.github.io â€” Data Portfolio Version 2 

Hey guys, here's the 2nd version of my Data Analysis Portfolio! 

I remember being asked if I *really* knew Data Analysis while in a job interview, by the interviewer *before the job interview even started*, and I can't remember feeling so insulted in my entire life. 

At least not since a month or two before when I received my exit letter from my last role, which I must say was the most condescending thing I ever read that was addressed to me in a professional context. I gave so much of myself to that job, sacrificed so much, and reading it broke me. 

Frankly, the last few months have been hard in a very interesting way, and I became very disillusioned with the idea of working anywhere, especially in the EdTech field. However, I'm here. I built this and every project featured on my portfolio and I'm moving forward. I'm not giving up. 

During the process of finding something new, I've met some really awesome people who have helped me in their own way along the way. People I'll always be grateful to for helping me in a bad situation. Work isn't supposed to be fun, but it is supposed to give you an opportunity at actualization; the ability to realize your potential.  

Work is also supposed to be an equivalent exchange, your time for their resources. If you think your are giving more of the former for not enough of the latter, and the other party is not willing to negotiate with you to adjust their terms, then parting ways is the only viable option. 

If you take away anything from reading this, no matter how hard things get, push forward. Do well because you want to do well and eschew the need to please others by living up to their expecations. 

Thank you,
Bruce
