## Overview
Hey guys, 

Welcome to my data portfolio! 

 Somewhere along the line, I've met some really awesome people who have helped me in their own way, along this path to finding a new role that I can take pride in. I'll always be grateful to those who tried to help me whilst caught up in a bad situation.

If you take away anything from reading this, no matter how hard things get, push forward. Do well because you want to do well and eschew the need to please others by living up to their expecations. 

Thank you,
Bruce
