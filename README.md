# brucelee352.github.io — Version 2 

## Overview
Hey guys, here's the 2nd version of my Data Analysis Portfolio—this time, built with Jekyll! 

The last few months have been hard in a unique way. Somewhere along the line, I came to misunderstand why people work and what that has to do with their perceived place in the world. 

I also came to realize that in my own career, I lost understanding of the why behind how to find meaning in pursuing life outside of your profession. 

During the process of finding something new to do, I've met some really awesome people who have helped me in their own way, along this path. People I'll always be grateful to for trying to help me in a bad situation, while helping me to look at things in a different light. 

Work is supposed to give you an opportunity at actualization; the ability to realize your potential. 

If you take away anything from reading this, no matter how hard things get, push forward. Do well because you want to do well and eschew the need to please others by living up to their expecations. 

Thank you,
Bruce
