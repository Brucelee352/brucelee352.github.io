## Hello!

Welcome! This is my data portfolio. If you happened to wander here, I thank you for your consideration of myself and my experiences. This website is a collection of projects and information meant to definitivly answer the question: "You know how to do Data Analysis?"...

I want to thank everyone that I was able to learn from along the way that helped me get to even the point where I was able to make this website, let alone do data things. I take so much pride in what I do, I hope that comes through with my work here. 

I recommend that you check out my [about page](https://brucelee352.github.io/about/), if you're interested in learning more on myself.
