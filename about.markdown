### Who am I? 

My name is Bruce A. Lee, I'm a Data Engineer from Florida, and also an alumni of the University of Central Florida, go Knights! My skillset comprises of SQL, Python, R for statistical analysis, Tableau and Excel.

My desire to work in data came out of a realization that many of the statistical methods that I learned from my undergrad could supplement my love of asking hard questions as a means to affect change. So I put myself to work in learning R with a friend's help, while studying the base concepts of what it means to work with tidy and messy data after working my day job at the time. 

### Why hire me?

My communication style stirs people into action, and I like to ask intentional questions to uncover the intentions behind why a decision was made, so as to fine-tune an approach on an issue or pivot to something different. I find this approach to be pivotal when formulating what kind of data pipeline is most ideal to suit the business needs of the org. 

With that said, I love to unravel how a business works, so that I can improve it through process refinement and iteration. When it comes to understanding a business, I look for certain outcomes that are important to growing the org, through asking my stakeholders what metrics are essential so that I can make data as accessible as possible. Especially for downstream consumers.
