### Who am I? 

My name is Bruce A. Lee, I'm a Data Analyst from Florida, and also an alumni of the University of Central Florida. My analytical toolset comprises of SQL (postgreSQL), R Programming (for data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical analysis), Tableau and Excel; with working adoption of Python. 

My desire to work in data came out of a realization that many of the statistical methods that I learned from my undergrad (go Knights!) could supplement my love of asking hard questions as a means to affect change. So I put myself to work in learning R with a friend's help, while studying the base concepts of what it means to work with tidy and messy data after working my day job at the time. 

From there, I started to learn SQL and things started to come together, as I'd been using Microsoft Excel in my work for a few years up until then. Now, I want the opportunity to meaningfully contribute insights to your business.

### Why hire me?

Once I set my sights on something, I do not let up and until I can feel satisfied that my job was completed and that my stakeholders are happy with the outcome. My communication style stirs people into action, and I like to ask intentional questions to uncover the intentions behind why a decision was made, so as to fine-tune an approach on an issue or pivot to something different. 

I love to unravel how a business works, so that I can improve it through process refinement and iteration. When it comes to understanding a business, I look for certain outcomes that are important to growing the org, through asking my stakeholders what metrics are essential so that I can make reporting as concise as possible. Through doing this, it becomes easier to unravel patterns that I can then use to solve problems, or at least outline a plan to tackle them. 

Lastly, as I find that the most successful analysts understands their audience, I strive to be adaptable enough to know what storytelling style suits the situation best. I enjoy getting to know the people I'm working with, understanding their needs, and communication style.
